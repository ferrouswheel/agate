## When originally released as Repeat-Finder 1.0

The original source code was based on [Sputnik](http://espressosoftware.com/sputnik/index.html) However, limitations
in that code lead to the entire system being rewritten to handle arbitary
length FASTA files with other numerous extensions. The "expected" program is
still based on the original framework however, and some elements of Sputnik may
still exist in ppt-mismatch. The author of Sputnik was contacted to get permission
to officially release this software under the GPL (see COPYING)

All original coding was done by Joel Pitt (joel.pitt@gmail.com) in 2006 with
project direction guided primarily by Andrew Bagshaw at Canterbury University.

The Canterbury University Genetics lab, run by Neil Gemmell, arranged funding for
Joel to spend focussed time on developing Repeat-Finder, although Joel has
spent significantly more time working on Repeat-Finder outside of the arranged
funding.
