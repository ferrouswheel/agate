PREREQUISITES

RepeatFinder has been developed in C with a minimal of dependencies.
It should be compilable on any operating environment that supports
the standard ANSI C library.

By default the compilation system is setup to support the Make build
system supported by the GCC compiler

(A) SOURCE CODE DISTRIBUTION

RepeatFinder source code is currently distributed in 2 forms:

1) Officially released source code (e.g. repeatfinder-1.0.0.tar.gz or later)

  The Full source code version contains all the RepeatFinder source code
  required for compilation. It is distributed as one file (*.tar.gz
  package) and the version is composed of 3 numbers, e.g. 1.0.0

2) SVN or SVN Snapshots of source code (SVN or SVN snapshot)

  This version of the source code can be acquired either from the SVN
  repository (https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/repeatfinder) or as a snapshot
  (*.tar.gz package) of that SVN repository. The SVN snapshot name
  contains the date when the snapshot was created (checked out from
  the SVN repository), e.g. repeatfinder_svn_snapshot_2005_03_19.tar.gz


(B) COMPILATION

Simply typing make in the source directory should compile three executables:
repeat-finder, ppt-mismatch, and expected

If you don't have the Make build system you will have to compile and link the
source code yourself. You may need to check the Makefile environment variables
to see that they conform to your setup.

(C) RUNNING REPEATFINDER

See README for information about running the RepeatFinder tools.

(D) UPDATE OF SOURCE CODE (SVN or SVN snapshot only)

If you want to update your current source from
SVN, you have to perform a few steps:

    cd /location/of/repeatfinder-sourcecode/
    cvs update -dP
    ./configure ...
    make
    make install
